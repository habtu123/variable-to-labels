# How to change variables to labels in pentaho kettle using JavaScript 
The following project is uses the open data from UK governement on Road Safty https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data  
In the data the CSV files contain only variables and I will try to use pentaho transformation to change the variables to thier lebesl using JavaScript (Modified Java Script Value). 

The JavaScript will change the varibles (which are assigned numbers) to their perspective String labels. 

The Pentaho transformation takes the CSV, changes the values, ignores uncecessry fields and insterts them into different Tables
